//used by the OD estimation module (refer to the report titled Development
//of a Deployable Real-Time Dynamic Traﬃc Assignment System. Part A:
//Evaluation of Estimation and Prediction Capabilities for a detailed overview
//of the OD estimation module). The name of this ﬁle has been hard-coded.
//It should reside in the directory from which DynaMIT will be executed.

//The entries specify the weights associated with the measurement errors
//in the sensor counts and historical OD ﬂow estimates. The number of entries
//in the ﬁle is the sum of
//1. the number of sensors on the network, and
//2. the number of O-D pairs.

//The ﬁrst set of numbers (as many as the number of sensors) form the di-
//agonal of the counts weighting matrix. The second set of numbers (as many
//as the number of OD pairs) forms the diagonal of the OD ﬂows matrix.
