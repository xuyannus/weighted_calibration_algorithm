The code in this folder is purely written for algorithm design and test. The user don't need to use any code in this folder for DynaMIT calibration.

The toy model include synthetic tests with only matlab. The simulator is replaced by known linear (or non-linear) functions. These tests examine the performance of different calibration algorithms (SPSA, W-SPSA) and different ways to generate weight matrix (perfect, estimated before calibration--so called Wh, estimated during calibration--so called Wc).
